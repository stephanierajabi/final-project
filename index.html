      <h1>About Me.</h1>
      <p>From a young age, I remember being interested in mental health. As I got older, my interests in psychology deepened, as did my pursuit of knowledge of this field. I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at McGill University. I enrolled in numerous clinical psychology classes, and immersed myself in autobiographies, scholarly articles, and documentaries related to mental health. It was important that I understood all sides of the problem - the social, psychological and neurobiological. To further my education in the feild of psychology, I will be continuing my studies in McGill University's graduate program in the department of Educational and Counseling Psychology.</p>

    <h1>My Experience.</h1>
    <p> In my third year of university I studied the neurobiological underpinnings of depression under the supervision of Dr. Rosemary Bagot. Although interesting, I was more drawn to human clincal psychological research. Duing the summer of 2017, I was awarded the Bertha Lapitsky Award in Child Development and worked under the supervision of Dr. Melanie Dirks. We primarily investigated the effects of peer victimization on internalizing symptoms in adolescents. I was trained to conduct semi-structured interviews with adolescent girls, gaining valuable experience discussing sensitive topics related to victimization and interpersonal challenges that transpired throughout their days. Additionally, I have been involved in community volunteer programs both internally with McGill and in collaboration with Batshaw and externally with Compeer Montreal. The McGill Youth Outreach Program involves weekly visitation to Jeanne Sauve, a female junvenile detention center, and a boy's group located in Montreal. Compeer Montreal is a peer support systems that emphasizes social support and community integration.</p>

    <h1>My Interests.</h1>
    <p>Over the years I have developed a variety of interests spanning across externalizing, such as conduct disorder, oppositional defiant deviant disorder, and substance abuse disorder and internalizing disorders, such as depression and anxiety. After a year of working with adolescents, it became abundantly clear to me that this was the demographic I felt most connected to. My interest in working with adolescents has led me to pursue a graduate degree in counseling psychology and wish to later obtain a career as a high school guidance/addiction counselor. </p>
